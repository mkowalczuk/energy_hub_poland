**Energy Hub Poland** is an advanced Home Assistant integration designed specifically for the Polish energy market. It allows you to monitor electricity prices, analyze costs, and optimize energy consumption based on actual tariffs (including dynamic RCE rates).

A unique feature is the **Comparison Mode**, which analyzes your consumption patterns and recommends the most cost-effective tariff for your household. Recent updates also add practical sensors for everyday automations, including price status, the best hour to run a load, and savings potential.

## 🌟 Features and Operation Modes

The integration supports four main operational modes:

### 1. 📉 Dynamic Mode (RCE)
Fetches hourly market rates directly from PSE/TGE (Polish Power Exchange).
* Perfect for prosumers on net-billing.
* Displays net prices (excluding VAT and distribution fees).
* Includes practical sensors such as price status (`cheap/normal/expensive`), the best hour to run a load, and savings potential.

### 2. 🏠 G12 Mode
Classic Time-of-Use (ToU) tariff defined by the user.
* Allows manual entry of peak hours ranges (e.g., `6-13,15-22`).
* Tracks costs separately for peak and off-peak zones.
* Tariff status sensor (`peak/offpeak` zone) for automations.

### 3. 🏖️ G12w Mode (Weekend)
Extended ToU tariff that accounts for the Polish holiday calendar.
* Automatically treats **Saturdays, Sundays, and Polish statutory holidays** as off-peak zones.
* Uses the `holidays` library for precise detection of non-working days in Poland.
* Tariff status sensor (`peak/offpeak` zone) for automations.

### 4. 📊 Comparison Mode (Experimental)
The integration's most powerful feature.
* Calculates energy costs for **all three tariff types simultaneously** in real-time.
* Indicates potential savings if you were to switch tariffs.
* Requires a connected energy meter sensor (kWh, `total_increasing` type).

### 🆕 What's New

Recent updates add several practical sensors for Dynamic Mode:
* **Price status** – classifies the current price as cheap, normal, or expensive.
* **Best usage hour** – suggests the most favorable hour to run a load.
* **Savings potential** – shows how much can be saved by shifting usage to the cheapest hour.

The sensor logic was also stabilized and expanded with regression tests.

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Installation via HACS

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2. Search for `Energy Hub Poland`.
3. Click **Download**.
4. **Restart Home Assistant**.

### Step 2: Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**.
2. Click the **Add Integration** button.
3. Search for **Energy Hub Poland**.
4. Follow the configuration wizard:
   * Select your default operation mode.
   * Input your energy meter entity (required for cost calculations).
   * Define peak hours (if using G12).

## 💡 Usage Examples

Here is how you can leverage Energy Hub Poland in your automations:

* **Smart Charging:** Start your EV charger only when the dynamic tariff price drops below a certain threshold.
* **Automation based on price status:** Switch on a device when the price status sensor reports `cheap`, or delay it when it reports `expensive`.
* **Savings Alerts:** Receive a notification at the end of the month with insights from Comparison Mode: *"If you used the G12w tariff, you would have saved 50 PLN this month."*
* **Visual Indicators:** Change your living room light color to red when the current energy price is in the daily peak range.

## 📈 Visualization - ApexCharts

To visualize dynamic prices (RCE) on a chart, we recommend using the **ApexCharts** card. Below is the ready-to-use configuration code.

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure you have the [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) installed via HACS.
2. Add a new "Manual" card to your Lovelace dashboard.
3. Paste the following code:

```yaml

      if (today) {
        Object.entries(today).forEach(([hour, price]) => {
          data.push([startTs + (parseInt(hour) * 3600000), price]);
        });
      }

      if (tomorrow && Object.keys(tomorrow).length > 0) {
        Object.entries(tomorrow).forEach(([hour, price]) => {
          data.push([startTs + 86400000 + (parseInt(hour) * 3600000), price]);
        });
      }
      return data.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
```

### ⚡ Energy Dashboard Integration
To ensure Home Assistant correctly calculates costs in the official Energy dashboard:

Go to Settings -> Dashboards -> Energy.

In the Grid Consumption section, edit your energy source (meter).

In the Use an entity with current price field, select: sensor.energy_hub_current_price.

Save changes.
